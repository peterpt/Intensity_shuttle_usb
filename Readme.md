- This project was build using google ai assistance over multiples sessions
this project uses a modiefied wrapper of libbmusb that we had to adjust for the
multiples resolutions , this driver is native and it will work with your older
i5 or amd64 cpu .




This app does not require a driver from blackmagic for linux , but it requires the reneseas usb3 chipset required from blackmagic .
