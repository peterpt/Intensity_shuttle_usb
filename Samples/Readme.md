Compiling.mp4
this video shows i compiling the optimized wrapper from bmusb0.7.8 , then rebuilding
the libshim.so witch is the required file for the python script to talk with bmusb wrapper
also you can see me launching the app , starting a video clip on another computer witch
it is streaming the hdmi signal to intensity shuttle , you will listen the sound
when videoclip starts but then it is cut off because i told vlc to send the audio
to the hmi port so it could be recorded in video in our python script , you can
check the audio signals in app .

capture.mp4
is the recorded video from python script that uses ffmpeg to do that job and converts
the video directly to mp4 .
